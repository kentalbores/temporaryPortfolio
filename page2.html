            <p>“The “joy of discovery” is one of the fundamental joys of play itself. 
                Not just the joy of discovering secrets within the game, but also the joy of 
                uncovering the creator’s vision. It’s that “Aha!” moment where it all makes sense, 
                and behind the world the player can feel the touch of another creative mind. In order 
                for it to be truly joyful, however, it must remain hidden from plain view—not carved as
                 commandments into stone tablets but revealed, piece by piece, through the player’s exploration
                  of the game’s rules.”
               <br> ― Derek Yu, Spelunky</p>
            <p>“The designer's real goal is to enrich the player's internal experiences. That goal is harder
                 to achieve, and it's damned difficult to measure. But it's the truth. And pursuing that truth 
                 makes your designs smaller, simpler, more focused, and more elegant than they could ever get by 
                 strategy counting.”

                <p><span>Achieving</span> goals is an important part of leading a fulfilling and successful life. 
                    Setting goals helps us to focus our efforts, stay motivated, and make progress 
                    towards what we want to achieve. However, achieving goals is not always easy and 
                    requires dedication, discipline, and a plan.
                   
                    <p> <span>One</span> key to achieving goals is to set specific and achievable targets. This means 
                    breaking larger goals down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and setting deadlines 
                    for each step. This helps to keep you on track and motivated, and allows you to track 
                    your progress and see the progress you are making.</p>
                  
                    <p> <span>Another</span> important aspect of achieving goals is to stay motivated and focused. This 
                    means regularly reminding yourself of the benefits of achieving your goals and rewarding 
                    yourself for making progress. It is also important to stay positive, even when faced 
                    with setbacks or obstacles. Remember, achieving your goals is a journey and it is
                     important to be patient and persistent. With hard work and determination, you can 
                     achieve any goal you set for yourself.</p>
